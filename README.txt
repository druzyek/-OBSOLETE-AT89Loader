AT89Loader v0.2

WARNING: FTDI does not recommend using their serial cable in SPI mode. Using this utility
to do so may not be reliable!

This utility programs firmware into AT89LP6440 microcontrollers using an FTDI USB to
serial cable instead of the parallel cable usually used to program them. It may work on
similar chips like the AT89LP3240 but it has not been tested. Use it at your own risk.

The program was compiled with Visual C++ 2010. It requires the D2XX header and library
files available here: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

These are the default pin connections. They can be changed in software.

MCU SS   <----> FTDI Brown
